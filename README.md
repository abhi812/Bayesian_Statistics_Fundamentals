# Bayesian_Statistics_Fundamentals
This is a part of my class work which provides fundamentals about the Bayesian Statistical analysis.
All the coding has been done in R and using R markdown reports have been generated in HTML as well as PDF.

This work focusses mainly on:

1.) Bay's theorem
2.) Posterior calculation using prior and likelihood
3.) MCMC- Monte Carlo Markov Chain modelling and diagnostics
4.) Gibbs sampling, JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler)
5.) Using LaTeX in R markdown for generating automated reports.

Tools used: R, R markdown, Latex, ggplot, JAGS, GIBBS, MCMC
